# Valkyr Database

`@valkyr/db` provides a mongo like persistent storage solution for browsers which comes with multiple storage adapter solutions. It's meant to provide an agnostic data layer which can be used for any popular web based framework such as `react`, `vue`, `svelte`, `angular`, and any other framework.

It's a write side storage solution written to compliment [mingo](https://github.com/kofrasa/mingo) used for the read side.

This solution is specifically written for client side storage, and is not optimized for performance. The main focus of `@valkyr/db` is to provide a simple but powerful data toolkit for quality of life.
